# Heteroscedastic-Weighted-Least-Squares
A special case of generalized least squares called 
weighted least squares occurs when all the off-diagonal 
entries of Î© (the correlation matrix of the residuals) 
are null; the variances of the observations 
(along the covariance matrix diagonal) 
may still be unequal (heteroscedasticity).
